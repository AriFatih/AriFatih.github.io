I have worked in different sectors but especially in Security-Printing sector. I have worked as an Engineer and as a Project Manager for 11 years.  From concept design to production I have managed to finish some projects. 

	For a year I am trying to learn IT technologies as an alternative profession and I am eager to learn more.
I can define myself as hardworking, responsible and multi-task person. At the same time that I am flexible and ready to fulfill my task as a Team member.

	<h3>Hello, My name is Fatih!</h3>
	<p> I come from Turkey, I am  38 years old and living in Bern.I have a Bachelor and Master degree in Mechanical Engineering.
I have worked in different sectors but especially in Security-Printing sector. I have worked as an Engineer and as a Project Manager for 11 years.  From concept design to production I have managed to finish some projects. 
For a year I am trying to learn IT technologies as an alternative profession.
The reason that I am looking for an internship is that I would like to carry my capabilities in an innovative company and I am eager to learn more.
I can define myself as hardworking, responsible and multi-task person. At the same that I am flexible and ready to fulfill my task as a Team member.
I am looking to have an interview with you and to meet you in person, Thank youâ€¦

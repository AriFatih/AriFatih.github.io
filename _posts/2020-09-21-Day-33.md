Today we have continued to learn about HTML and CSS. In the morning session we (Candas and me) have asked the quiz questions to our collagaues. The questions are about the previos week's subjects. We have also learned something with SUsanne's live coding session. In the afternoon session Susanne explained box model of CSS.



<h3>Quiz: </h3>
This week was our turn and we prepared 20 questions for the quiz. Our collegaues answered those questions and we have tried to explain as far as we know.


<h3> Livecoding with Susanne: </h3>
Susanne wrote codes that we said and she also added many things and recommended also some best practices.


<h3> Box Model-CSS: </h3>
Everything in CSS is thought as box and there are some methods to place the things in these boxes. Float, Flex and Grid are these methods. They are not so easy to understand, I have to study a little more.

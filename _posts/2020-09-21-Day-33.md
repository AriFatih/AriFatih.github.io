We have also learned something with SUsanne's live coding session. In the afternoon session Susanne explained box model of CSS.



<h3>Quiz: </h3>
We have completed some assignments which measures our programming level and the results will help with planning the rest of the course.


<h3> Livecoding with Susanne: </h3>
SUsanne wrote codes that we said and she also added many things and recommended also some best practices.


<h3> Box Model-CSS: </h3>
Everything in CSS is thought as box and there ara some methods to place the things in these boxes. Float, Flex and Grid are these methods. They are not so easy to understand, I have to study a little more.

Today we were in Zürich for a coding day. 


<h3>Live-Code:</h3>
In the morning session we have made a Live-code with Susanne. We have solved the problem from Hour of code. It was good to  learn new things.


<h3> Group Work: </h3>
With our group we have worked on a problem. We were together with Hasan, Ayse, Lynn, Samar and I. It was very good to solve something but I have remarked that: I have to exercise more. The exercise was mainly about key-codes and eventListener.

<h3> Culturel Presentation: </h3>
I and Candas presented about the remaining part of the Turkey. Even I learned something about my country. After the presentation we ate the "Cig-Köfte" which Ayse prepared for us.

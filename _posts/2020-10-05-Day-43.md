Today we have continued to learn about Javascript. In the morning session we Anil, Ayse and Hasan have asked the quiz questions to us. The questions were about the previos week's subjects. The second part of the morning session Mark told about P5js which is a library of JavaScript.  In the afternoon session we have worked on exercises of last week and a new exercises.



<h3>Quiz: </h3>
This week was Anil, Ayse and Hasan's turn and they prepared 19 questions for the quiz. We answered those questions and we have tried to explain as far as we know.


<h3> P5js: </h3>
Mark explained something about P5js and libraries. It is really useful and funny to work with that.

<h3> Exercises: </h3>
We did the exercises from last Friday and also we have worked on a new project which is "ToDo list". I can do those exercises however I am so slow to manage those.

Today we are at home and working alone:
We have started to the day with an online Checkin.  Then I have worked on the slides of Susanne about JavaScript. In the afternoon Susanne sent us a OneHourCode challenge.That was about Pseudocoding. 

<h3> CheckIn: </h3>
The question of the checkin was the coffee or tea amount that we drink for a day.


<h3> Javascript: </h3>

I have finished the the slides about Programming basics.

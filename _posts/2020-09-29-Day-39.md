Today we are at home and working alone:
We have started to the day with an online Checkin.  Then I have worked on the slides of Susanne about JavaScript. In the afternoon Susanne sent us a OneHourCode challenge.That was about Pseudocoding. 

<h3> CheckIn: </h3>
The question of the checkin was the coffee or tea amount that we drink for a day.


<h3> Javascript: </h3>

I have finished the the slides about JavaScrips basics.

<h3> Hour Of Code : </h3>

The hour of code was about Pseudeocodes, I thought it was good, but I should  have written inputs, outputs and constraints. Because of that the result is not good.

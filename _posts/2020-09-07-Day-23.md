<h3> Get to know each other more: </h3>
We are 16 participants from different countries of the world...
Also there are 3 lead and 1 lead-assistant who manage the program.
They are really good and sincere people, I hope our friendship and cooeration continues for a long time.


<h3> Trust and Self-Confidence Workshop: </h3>
The workshop was a very good introduction program for us. It was really interesting and helpful.
I can remember all of my colleagues' name by the help of this workshop. By this program I had also a chance to learn about the others more.

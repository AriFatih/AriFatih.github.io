Today we are at home and working home-office:
We have started to the day with an online Checkin.  Then I have worked on the slides of Susanne about JavaScript. 


<h3> Javascript and DOM: </h3>

I have finished the slides about JavaScrip and DOM. DOM is not an easy subject and I have to study more.

Today we are at home and working alone:
We have startedto the day with an online Checkin.  Then I have worked on the slides of Susanne about Programming 101. I repeated also some CSS. In the afternoon Susanne sent us a OneHourCode challenge. My score was 34/60 and I have understood that I have to study more.

<h3> CheckIn: </h3>
The question of the checkin was our siblings and their influence at our life.


<h3> Programming 101: </h3>

I have finished the the slides about Programming basics.

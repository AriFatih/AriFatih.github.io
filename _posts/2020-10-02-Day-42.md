We are again at home. As usual we have meet at 9 am on Zoom and we had a checkin adn Susanne had some announcements... Our subject for today is Functions, Arrays and Objects.



<h3> Functions-Arrays:</h3>
I  went through the slides which Susanne sent. I watched also the video about the subject.

<h3> Objects: </h3>
I have finished the materials but I have to read more about objects, because it is really an interesting subject.


<h3> Exercises: </h3>
I have finished 4 of the exercises which were at the end of the slides.

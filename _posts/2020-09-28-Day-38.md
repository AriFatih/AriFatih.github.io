Today we had a recap about CSS especially about Grid and Flex. In the morning session we have learned via with Susanne's live coding session. In the afternoon Session we tried to use Grids and Flex.



<h3> Livecoding with Susanne: </h3>
We have worked on Flex and Grid. It was not easy to understand. I have done but have to study more.

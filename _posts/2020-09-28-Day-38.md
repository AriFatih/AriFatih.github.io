Today we had a recap about CSS especially about Grid and Flex. In the morning session we have learned via with Susanne's live coding session. In the afternoon Session we tried to use Grids and Flex.



<h3>Quiz: </h3>
This week was our turn and we prepared 20 questions for the quiz. Our collegaues answered those questions and we have tried to explain as far as we know.


<h3> Livecoding with Susanne: </h3>
Susanne wrote codes that we said and she also added many things and recommended also some best practices.


<h3> Box Model-CSS: </h3>
Everything in CSS is thought as box and there are some methods to place the things in these boxes. Float, Flex and Grid are these methods. They are not so easy to understand, I have to study a little more.

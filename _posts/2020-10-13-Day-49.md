Today we were at home and worked home-office:
We have started to the day with an online Checkin.  Then I have worked on the slides and videos of Susanne about JSON and AJAX. In the afternoon session we had an "Hour Of Code" session.


<h3> JSON and AJAX: </h3>

I have finished the slides and videos about JSON and AJAX. They are very useful and making the life easier but I have to make some practices because the slides include theoretical informations.

<h3> Hour Of Code: </h3>
As usual like every tuesday we had a hour of code session. The main aim of this hour is to be fast and to deliver the task before the deadline. The task was "Creating a background gradient generator." I have created that on time however it was staticand  Susanne wanted to have a dynamic one with a function of Javascript.
The desired output was like the one in image.

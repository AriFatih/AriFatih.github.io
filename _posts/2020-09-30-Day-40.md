Today is the social skills day. From 9 to 12 Amanda and Lydia from Schindler presented about "Interview Skills". In the afternoon part of the day  every person had a Mock Interview for 45 minutes.



<h3> Interview Skill </h3>
It was very valuable to hear something about interview skills. It was very interesting and helpful.

Today we have continued to learn about Javascript. In the morning session Abbas have asked the quiz questions to us. The questions were mainly about DOM and events. In the second part of the morning session Susan told us about Libraries and Frameworks. In the afternoon we have worked on exercises.



<h3>Quiz: </h3>
This week was Abbas' turn and he prepared 10 questions for the quiz. We answered those questions and we have tried to explain.

<h3> Libraries-Frameworks: </h3>
Susanne explained briefly frameworks and libraries. They are really useful but so rich and difficult to decide where to begin.
